# 🕹️ Pong Game

A simple Pong game made using Python and the Turtle graphics module.  
This project was part of my #100DaysOfCode journey.

## Features
- Two-player paddle control  
- Ball movement and collision detection  
- Scoreboard to keep track of points  
- Dividing line for better layout

## How to Play
- **Right Paddle:** Use the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys  
- **Left Paddle:** Use the **W** and **S** keys  
- Keep the ball from going past your paddle.  
- The first player to let the ball pass loses a point!

## Goal of the Game
Keep the ball in play and try to score by making your opponent miss!
